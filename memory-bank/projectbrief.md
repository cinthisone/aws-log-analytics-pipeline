# Project Brief: AWS Log Analytics Pipeline

## Purpose
Build a serverless data analytics pipeline on AWS to collect, process, analyze, and visualize website access logs using S3, Glue, Athena, and QuickSight.

## Core Requirements
- Ingest raw web server logs (Apache/Nginx or simulated) into S3.
- Use AWS Glue to parse, clean, and transform logs into a structured format (Parquet).
- Store processed data in S3 for efficient querying.
- Use Athena to run SQL queries on processed data.
- Visualize key metrics and trends in QuickSight dashboards.

## Goals
- Demonstrate end-to-end data engineering and DevOps skills on AWS.
- Provide actionable insights from web access logs (traffic, errors, user agents, etc.).
- Showcase best practices for serverless analytics pipelines.
